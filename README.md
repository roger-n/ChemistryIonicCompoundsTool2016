# ChemistryIonicCompoundsTool2016
Again, uploading an old project from Google Drive to github 
Got bored in AP Chemistry 2016 so I made this small application for chemical nomenclature
Basically the general chemistry students were struggling and at the time I would rather have built this program to do it for them...
instead of just teaching it to my classmates because there were so many of them
This was a much faster project because I had finally learned how to use Swing somewhat consistently
